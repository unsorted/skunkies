Yep 2020 is almost over, nice to write a sumup of the react state at @sortlist. So let's dig
into it in music.

## Introduction

I joined Sortlist around in December 2019 as a React frontend developer. At that time it was not really clear
how to initiate an AngularJs exit. Which technologies, stacks, languages, design... ? But what was sure
is that maintaining an unsupported technology would definitely be a dead end. The **Why?** was partially answered.

And it was good...

then came a series of questions, opinions, statements... cause when we started
we tried to communicate and talk about it.

> Why react ? - Isn't it better to go Angular 2 ? - Typescript is slow ? -
> How long will it take ? - Who will work on this ? - I don't like it -
> I like graphql - There's too much code to migrate, it's impossible. why not using
> bootstrap, semantic-ui, ui-kit ? - I don't have time - Will fail - Will be ready next week.

Then over the months we went through. Not without a plan, so here's some

## Lorem Ipsum

```jsx codesandbox=react
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello sortlist!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));
